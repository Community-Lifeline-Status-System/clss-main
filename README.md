# Community Lifeline Support System (CLSS)
**Real Data. Real-Time Impact. Real Resilience.**

## 🌐 About CLSS

The **Community Lifeline Support System (CLSS)**  operationalizes real data for real-time impact assessments, highlighting critical community impacts and enhancing your community's resilience. Supported by DHS S&T, the CLSS was built specifically to support existing EOC data and information gathering workflows. It helps agencies focus, assess, and make decisions on what matters: the right data at the right time through the common framework of Community Lifelines.

The CLSS has been built and validated through direct contribution from over 300 emergency management agencies nationwide, ensuring the system meets the needs of emergency managers from the State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) levels. Now, the time has come to embrace the future of data informed decision making.


CLSS can be extended and integrated with:

- **Incident Management Systems**  
  Integrate with platforms like WebEOC to synchronize lifeline status and assessment data.  
  See: [WebEOC Integration Jumpstart](clss-notebooks/weboc-integration/README.md)

- **Microsoft Teams**  
  Embed CLSS dashboards and workflows directly into Teams for enhanced collaboration and situational awareness.  
  See: [Integrating CLSS in Teams](CLSS-TeamsIntegration.md)

- **ArcGIS Dashboard & Survey123**  
  Connect CLSS with ArcGIS Dashboards for visualization and with Survey123 for field data collection and automated assessments.  
  See: [CLSS Dashboard](clss-dashboard/readme.md) | [CLSS Survey123](clss-survey123/)

- **Notification Platforms**  
  Enable notifications via Microsoft Power Automate, Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, or on-premises solutions to alert users of key events and status changes.  
  See: [Enabling CLSS Notifications](CLSS-Notifications.md)

- **Automated Impact Assessments**  
  Automate indicator impact assessments using data-driven thresholds and logic.
