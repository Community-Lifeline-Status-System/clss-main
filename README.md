## 🌐 About CLSS

The **Community Lifeline Support System (CLSS)**  operationalizes real data for real-time impact assessments, highlighting critical community impacts and enhancing your community's resilience. Supported by DHS S&T, the CLSS was built specifically to support existing EOC data and information gathering workflows. It helps agencies focus, assess, and make decisions on what matters: the right data at the right time through the common framework of Community Lifelines.

The CLSS has been built and validated through direct contribution from over 300 emergency management agencies nationwide, ensuring the system meets the needs of emergency managers from the State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) levels. Now, the time has come to embrace the future of data informed decision making.
